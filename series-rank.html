    <h1>The Best Series According to Natalia Paduraru</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 series of all-time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h2>Succession (2018) </h2>
    <p>Succession is an intense drama about familial relations and power in the modern world.</p>
    <h2>Maid (2021)</h2>
    <p>The series that really deserves to be seen, based on a true story of a woman trying to make a better life for herself and her toddler.</p>
    <h2>Modern Family (2009-2020)</h2>
    <p>I like this pretty funny sitcom, that's absolutely worth watching. </p>
